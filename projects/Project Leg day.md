summary: "An ongoing leg day fitness project"
---

The year was 2024. I'd been going to the gym for 2 years by then, and leg day was more of an after thought. I had a routine, of course, but I would typically just work out another muscle group rather than do a full leg day. Come new years, I'm celebrating with my friends and one of them brings up resolutions. I jokingly say "I won't skip a leg day this entire year" fully planning on breaking it in about a month. Well turns out, legs are very important, and having chicken legs while you have a defined upper body is extremely embarassing. Despite being the hardest, and least favorite of mine, I kept consistent. After 3 months, I had forgotten about the resolution, as I was automatically fitting a leg day into every single week. As I'm writing this near the end of 2025, I can say with confidence, I have never missed a leg day with exception of being sick, or on a trip. So take this as motivation I guess. One day or day one typa thing you know?
