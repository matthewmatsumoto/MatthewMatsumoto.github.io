## It All Starts With Brainstorming

From the very beginning, we had a good idea of what our application would be. Teammate and fellow Computer Science major Joan, suggested the idea that became TeamUHp. She was given the suggestion of a "help wanted"-esque site by a friend. Having a concept this early was great, as it gave us valuable time to brainstorm other aspects such as aesthetics and layout. 

## What is TeamUHp?

TeamUHp is a collaborative web platform designed to connect people around project-based work. Users can create project listings that include key details such as required skills, number of collaborators needed, deadlines, and compensation. After logging in, users are presented with a streamlined dashboard where they can browse projects seeking collaborators or easily switch to view and manage their own listings.

# What was my role in TeamUHp?

My main role in TeamUHp was to decorate the page, and provide a drafts for the landing and sign in page. Along with this, I drafted and made the logo, and landing page effects. 

Despite not having the hardest job in the group, I still learned a lot about teamwork, agile project management, and working diligantly. It was my first experience being apart of a computer related group project, and was a glimpse into the software engineering field as a whole. 

Below is the first draft:P
