Back in 2021, I was an avid Minecraft player. I would always use these things called "texture packs" which were basically reskins of all the minecraft textures. One day, I thought hey, I'm (acceptable) at art, why not just make my own. I began by copying all the texture files and putting it into a folder. Then all I had to do was draw over the existing ones to change the texture. For most blocks, it was pretty simple, as their textures were just one of their faces wrapped around a cube 6 different times. The difficult part, was the 3D models. That's when I found out how important it is to set the correct file directories. Each individual limb had to be recolored and retextured, and the only way at the time I could test it, was to open an instance of the game, and view the model myself. With much trial and error, I found the correct way to name and direct each individual file, so ethe 3D models would actually wrap correctly. I never actually ended up finishing the pack, but I changed all the essentials. On the occasions I play Minecraft today, I always use what I made all those years ago.
