summary: "It's just setting up new computers. How hard could that be"
---

I've been working for miller hall since the beginning of summer. Aside from typical office work, I'm also their unofficial "IT guy". I say that with heavy emphasis on unofficial, because for one, my job title is technically clerical worker. And 2, I was basically the only person that was tech literate throughout the entire building. Don't take this as me complaining, because being able to start doing anything computer related is more my speed, and of course, looks good on my resume. 

Miller hall, for those who don't know, is the family and consumer sciences building. The computer lab though, was for the fashion design (consumer sciences) part. At this point, the fashion design department at Manoa was way past it's glory days of the 20th century, and fell into relative obscurity. Even I didn't know that was the fashion design building. Anyway, to keep up with some of the top fashion design programs in America, the department decided to purchase licenses for some of the newest, most advanced software cad programs on the market. The problem, is that they required at least a 4070, and the current computer lab, well, could barely run the version from 2023. 

I collaborated with multiple staff members to find an "affordable" computer that matched the specifications of the new software to use for the new lab. We ended up deciding on ASUS computers with 5060s if I remembered correctly. Still, relatively cheap. Of course, however, we ran into problems. Half of the computers shipped a month late, and arrived only a week before school started. At that point, we had put "stopgap" computers from the old computer lab into the new one. By the time they came in, we had to hurry. Moving 17 heavy computers, and setting them up in a way where the cables wouldn't tangle (the prior cable management was intended for the computers to go below the desk, but the new ones were too big). That was just the physical setup. For software, we first had to connect each computer to a domain in which we could download all the software through a shared file. Then, we had to activate all the licenses for said software. Only about halfway through that did we think to remotely access all of them so we didn't have to move around. Finally, it was done, with 2 days to spare. So if you ever come by the AgSci lab (no we couldn't fit them in miller hall), make sure to admire our "fabulous" work.
