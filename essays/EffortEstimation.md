## Estimating Effort

When it came to estimating the amount of effort it would take for each of the project's errors, I had to think reasonably in terms of my other group mates. Historically, with WODs, I would end with a time of "DNF" (did not finish). That means that I didn't finish the WOD within the max estimated time our professor gave us. When I estimated the time for issues I would solve myself, I was quite accurate. If the issue was for someone else to do though, I let someone else estimate it, as my group mates were much more skilled at coding than I was. 

## Was Effort Estimating Beneficial?

The short answer: no, not really. Estimating in advance didn't help me in any way, as I would either go over or under the estimated time. I never felt like I was on an actual timer, because I had much more time than the estimated time it would take, so naturally, I took it slowly to make sure everything was correct. 

## How Useful was Effort Tracking?

Tracking my actual effort was slightly useful, as the time estimations I made for the final project issues ended up aligning with the time I spent on them. Knowing that my estimations would be much higher than average, I reserved effort estimation to only issues I would work on. Other than that though, I saw no real benefit to it. If anything, it was more negative to my development as a software engineer as seeing my multitude of DNFs often discouraged me. 

## Tracking my Effort

Tracking my own effort through the semester was quite easy for me. The fact that I finished most WODs with DNF's which ranged from a few minutes to multiple hours over the max limit, I would just put "DNF". Specifically calculating by how much time I did not finish was unnecessary, as there was no "time" after DNF. 

## Reflection

Estimation tracking is a good idea to gauge your abilities, and realistically estimate the effort you would have to spend on a certain issue or project. Despite this, my process was flawed, as simply putting "DNF" along with the max time didn't say much, as no finishing ranged from minutes to hours as previously mentioned. If I were to do this all again, I would put the actual time I spent.
