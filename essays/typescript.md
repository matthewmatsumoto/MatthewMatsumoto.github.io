## Typescript? I barely know Java!

First thing I want to make clear, is that I'm not a great coder. Java and C were simply OK. Typescript felt like such coding languages, but with a lot more annoying syntax formatting. Having to learn a new coding language in around 4 days also made this experience suboptimal to say the least. The pace changing from learning a language in 2 semesters to one in 4 days was quite the shock. Despite this, I'm trying my very hardest to understand and practice this language. Thankfully, my current ICS314 course gives frequent practice problems to do with no pressure of making errors- something that led to me heavily relying on chatGPT in previous classes.

## Reflection on practice

When it came to the WODs (workouts of the day), I feel like I knew the general gist of it, and how I would go about completing each one. The problem, of course, is the syntax. While not exactly too different from previous languages I've learned, typescript makes things more complex- especially when you have to declare functions. Despite all this, being an assignment based on completion rather than correctness, it actually inspired me after I completed the assignment to redo it on my own, and finally figure out what I was doing wrong.

## Motivation and Confidence

Failure hurts. Whenever I can't figure something out or simply can't understand a subject, I can increasingly frusturated and begin to feel hopeless. Despite this, I keep trying, and tell myself that I will eventually succeed. Eventually, I'll understand. Even though the present often times seems uncertain, you have to realise that all things pass, so you have to do your best to not have regrets when the future eventually comes.
