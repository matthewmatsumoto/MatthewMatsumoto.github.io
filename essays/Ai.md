## An Intelligent Tool

Over the past few years, artificial intelligence has gained notoriety as one of the most powerful tools for computer scientists and average users alike. One thing that many AI models excel at is coding. Software engineering has never been more efficient, with AI standing ready to generate code, or help fix errors that you may have made. I personally have used AI to generate starter code, and fix errors I could not solve myself throughout my programs. The only AI I've ever used for this task is ChatGPT, as it gives a straightforward answer 4/5 times. 

## Personal Experiences with AI

Experience WODs e.g. E18: I didn't use AI as I found it uncessesary. After all, the experiences were practice, and my time to learn their respective concepts. Along with that, the walkthrough videos were much more helpful than an AI explanation. 

In-class Practice WODs: For the In-class practice WODs, I used ai to help me when I got stuck on a certain part of the WOD. For example: For the practice "Island Snow" with bootstrap WOD, I had trouble formatting my navbar. I asked Chatgpt: Can you help center the navbar elements, and space them apart (inserted current code and style.css). Overall, the results were quite reliable, although sometimes the formatting would conflict with certain pieces of code from the template, making more of a problem. 

In-class WODs: For the in-class WODs, I heavily relied on AI to help perfect them. Oftentimes, like the practice WODs, I would find myself copying entire parts from the directions, and inputting them into ChatGPT along with my current code. Unlike the practice WODs however, I would typically need to do this less, as I had learned from the practice WODs how to tackle certain problems. AI overall didn't make much of a difference because I never ended up completing a single WOD in time.

Essays: I never use AI to write essays as it cannot replicate raw human writing. I find it's writing too perfect, even if I ask it to "simplify" what it had wrote. Additionally, writing isn't a huge focus in this class as it's no longer a writing intensive. 

Final project: For the final project, I found myself assigned to tasks similar to the website WODs. The biggest of which I was tasked to make a working mockup of the landing page, including navbar, footer, and body. Additional tasks consisted of "decorating" the application. I found myself using ChatGPT a lot during these as I didn't have a specific website to follow unlike the WODs. There was also a lot of trial and error, and seeing what style stuck. Example: Can you help me center the logo regardless of the screen dimensions, and make it have a fade in effect when opening the page? 

Learning a concept / tutorial: I rarely used AI to learn a concept, but it was much better than asking for the straight answer. For example: Can you explain to me the basics of formatting a navbar using bootstrap? Rather than just giving me the answer to copy and paste, it gave me reusable instructions for whenever I needed it. If there was ever any confusion, I could ask AI to "explain to me like I'm 10". 

Answering a question in class or in Discord: I never used AI to answer questions in class or discord. It's unnecessary to ask AI to help you ask a question, as it's a fairly simple thing to do. 

Asking or answering a smart-question: I never used AI to answer or ask smart questions. A question should always be sincere, and asking AI to help would make it sound less human. 

Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”: During many of the practice WODs, I would come across things I did not know the use of, or how to use it. I often asked ChatGPT to give an example if I didn't know or remember a use of a function. For example: What does .pluck do? AI was almost always a good place to ask for these kinds of questions, as the answer was very general, simply asking for example uses without any specific parameters.

Explaining code: Oftentimes, I would ask AI the use of certain code that the professor or TA wrote. If it wasn't explained it the walkthrough video, I would ask something like: Can you show what this code does? (Code). On most occasions, AI would run through step by step on what a certain piece of code did, proving to be very useful for my understanding. 

Writing code: I'm not the best at writing code from scratch, so I often relied on AI to write code for me. Typically, I would have some sembelence of what the assignment was asking of me. For example: Can you generate me a list queue function based on these directions (assignment directions). If I already had code to go along with it, I would put (assignment directions) and (current code). Overall, it was very useful. 

Documenting code: I never used AI to help document code. Although it was very accurate when it came to documentation, I never found a real use for it as most of the assignments were a one and done thing, and was graded on if it worked properly, not commenting on how the code worked. Additionally, when AI generated or fixed code, it would auto document anyways. 

Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code (code here)” or “Fix the ESLint errors in (code here)”: For quality assurance, I heavily relied on AI to help me. AI is perfect for this task, as it can read and point out mistakes the average human would not catch. Most of my questions were usually like this: Why doesn't this code (code) do (intended use). Or Can you fix this code to make it (do what its supposed to do). 

## Impact of AI on my learning and understanding. 

Having AI as a tool is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it can perform many tasks and solve a plethora or issue with great accuracy. On the other hand, most of the time, it's being prompted to provide an answer rather than explain it, leading to a solved problem, but nothing learned. The best way to learn something is to practice yourself, but if that practice is easily doable with a simple prompt, then you won't end up learning anything at all. This is concerning for many reasons, and studies are already being conducted on the negative impact on AI. I personally think that AI is good in moderation, or when you simply cant find the answer to a problem. 

## Practical Applications

Outside of this class, AI has been and will continue to be used throughout many projects. From my personal experience, I have seen AI be applied to video games. The issue of lower count or difficulty of a game is solved using bots. Bots, are computer operated characters that are mixed in with real players. Before the advancement of AI, bots were easy to identify with their choppy, unrealistic movemenets. But now, with many bot models using player data and activity as their model, they are much more "life-like" and sometimes even indistinguishable from a real human player. Other than that, almost every major company has AI chatbots built into their applications with varying success. 

## Challenges and Opportunities

The biggest challenge with AI is it's inability to comprehend context. This is often seen with language translation, having many errors without understanding the context and way a message is conveyed. This also applies to Software engineering. Oftentimes, you have to provide a lot of code and context for it to give you a good answer. If not, it will make various assumptions leading to an innacurate or undesirable answer. Despite all these downsides, AI, whether you like it or not, is the future of software engineering. Teaching future classes proper and effective ways to use it would be beneficial to their overall career.
