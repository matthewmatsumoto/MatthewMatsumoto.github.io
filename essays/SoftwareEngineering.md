## A Semester Recap

Software Engineering was a difficult class, but a great learning experience. Not only did it teach me how to build and configure web applications, but it also taught me various other fundamentals such as open source software development, UI frameworks, agile project management. This class was my first taste in web applications, and "professional" project building. Along with this, I learned about important social networking sites such as LinkedIn, and Slack. Unlike the other computer science classes I've taken, this one gave me a glimpse into the real world of software engineering jobs.

## Open Source Software Development

Open source software development consists of an already existing project/template that can be modified by others. My first glimpse into open source software development was with the bowfolios template. There was no specification as to what the bowfolios template had to be, but I added onto it as the assignment specified. My final project for the class was also technically open source, as some changes were added on after we had presumably finished everything. Overall, it felt like I was a part of something bigger, and was a glimpse into concepts like modding. 

## UI frameworks

UI frameworks have to be the most helpful tool I've used this semester. They're basically premade functions that you can add to your code, without having to code any of it yourself. Instead of having to code each individual function and feature, I could simply download a premade template with a single line of code. It's such a simple quality of life thing to have, but saves hours and hours of manual coding. Also, if you don't like the template, you can easily style it to your liking. 

## Agile Project Management

In the past I've worked on projects in an agile project management style, but never was it related to computer science, and never was it to this scale. Working as a group is nothing new to me, so collaboration was the easy part. The scale of the project however, was large, and I couldn't do it by myself. To get over this obstacle, me and my group decided to split up, and work on little parts at a time to form our complete project. This was much more efficient, and less stressful, as we had our own sizable workloads rather than everything being up to one person. Overall, it was my first time experiencing such a big project in software engineering, and was a very valuable experience.
