## My Experience With Bootstrap

Why use an automatic website builder when you can make a website from scratch? Bootstrap is one of the best UI frameworks for html and website building. Boostrap made the entire process much easier, with multiple shortcuts reducing the time it takes to configure my websites. Despite this, it was quite frusturating to deal with. It is significantly different from html, which we used for some earlier projects. Overall, bootstrap allowed for much more detail and website function, but was naturally a lot more complex. 

## My Personal Opinion on These Languages

Using HTML was a very easily digestible language, but that's probably because the projects written with html were a lot more simple. It was nostalgic seeing my html websites, reminding me of the late 2000's where most websites were just text, pictures, and very interesting color choices. Bootstrap, felt a lot more modern and streamlined. It was much easier to make something as complex as a navigation bar and menu, which would have taken forever in HTML. Bootstrap was still a lot to take in, and I still don't fully understand how to format a navigation bar. Overall, I enjoyed making functional websites much more than the random javascript and typescript programs we made.

<img width="500px"
