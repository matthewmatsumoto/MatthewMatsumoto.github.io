## Overview
*The Problem:* Many college students want to build real-world experience and strengthen their resumes through hands-on projects. However, the scope and complexity of meaningful and large-scale projects may exceed their current technical skills or confidence. Such a gap makes it difficult for students to initiate or complete projects that truly showcase their abilities.
*The Solution:* **Team UHP!** is a platform for students to connect across areas of study by enabling them to upload project postings and recruit collaborators. Whether it's a class assignment or a passion project, students can find teammates with complementary skills and allow each contributor to play a meaningful role that aligns with their field of study. This medium of collaboration helps students to gain practical experience, build teamwork skills, and add completed projects to their resumes.
## Approach
Instead of networking across multiple platforms to recruit members for a project, a poster can create a site that lists: 
* Overview of the project
* Tags that list the fields of knowledge for the project (positions/openings)
* Add Images to posting (optional)  
* “Wizard” for creating listings
* Contact email(s) for followup
* The more project tags that match your skills, the higher it is in the listing. 

Students who visit the site can create a profile of their skills, interests for projects, and a link to their portfolio’s/Socials/Contacts.

Students that upload their project postings can have a list of all projects under their profile details.

Admins can monitor the site for inappropriate content and create new tags of skills, majors, and positions to recruit.

## Mockup Page Ideas
* Landing page
* Login page
* Search page: browse projects by majors / project type (“technology,” “health,” etc.)
* Profile page 
* Project page
* Recommended projects page
* About platform page / platform learning (“How To’s”) 
* Admin Page

## Use Case Ideas
* New user goes to the landing page, logs in, gets the home page, sets up their profile.
* Users post projects and positions/skills they need but don’t have.
* Users go to search, finds projects using dictionary search, or filter search, or AI assistant
* User opens link to project’s page

## Beyond the Basics
* Connections (“friends list”)
* Thumbs up/down ratings (hidden vs. visible)
* Divide between “interests” and “non-interests”
* Weight classifieds based on parts filled out / specificity of tag (Python > Coding)
* “LLM” or dictionary to find synonyms in searches
