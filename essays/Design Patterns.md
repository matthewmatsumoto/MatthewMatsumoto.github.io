## For every problem comes a (typically) pre established solution

With any job and any procedural task comes a design pattern. For any common problems that come up in any project, simply making your own solution on the spot can be both time consuming, and further ruin an otherwise streamlined and standardized way of problem solving. Imagine a road if you will. The road has a pothole, and you are assigned to fix it. A design pattern may consist of filling up the pothole, or possibly paving over it. Now imagine you decided to do your own thing, and build an extension of the road around it. It ruins the standard fixing procedure, and interferes with the already set road. This is why design patterns are so important.

## Design patterns in software engineering

Now I want you to imagine yourself as a member of a project building a website. Your job is to add components to a navbar. WIthout a design pattern, you may add the components as asked, but that code may interfere with other elements of the website, either breaking it, or negatively effecting the website's other componenets.

## My experiences with Design patterns

When it comes to the project that I'm currently working on, I've realized the importance of design patterns. I was tasked to edit the format of the footer. Something relatively simple. Instead of following the design pattern of fitting the componenets into a column, I simply shifted them manually with a px measurement. This resulted in all the columns being off center, except for when I viewed it on my specific laptop's screen dimensions. Of course, I had to go fix it, and standardize the code. Later down the line, when we decided to change the font, rather than being at an uneven place on the screen, the text would fit in the middle of their respective columns, proving to also be customizable! So if you don't want inconsistancies with your project, follow the design patterns!
