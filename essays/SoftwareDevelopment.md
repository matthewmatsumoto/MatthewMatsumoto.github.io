## Software developing, an unprofessional overview. 

The word software development invokes a fear in me. I wouldn't say I'm too good at coding. I will say though, that coding with a purpose rather than for an assignment is much more interesting. Even though I'm nervous, I won't say I'm not excited to make an actual web application for my final project. In terms of actual software developing, I don't have any experience. My interest is really with security and all that "jazz". Unfortunately, UH Manoa does not have a designated security pathway, so I'm taking the closest thing. From what I've heard, software development is an over saturated field although I've been told that "you're going to have so many job opportunities". But, whatever right. It's the present day, everything changes so quickly.
