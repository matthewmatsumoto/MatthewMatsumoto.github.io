## Syntax errors 

When I first started coding, my biggest worry was with syntax. From my prior knowledge, I knew that syntax mattered. Whether it be a missing bracket, or mispelled word, just one mistake could invalidate your entire code. Unfortunately, those fears materialized, especially with html and typescript. Being used to java having (relatively) simple syntax, the coding standanrds of html, js, and ts were a wakeup call. 

After downloading EsLint and other coding addons, I was flooded with errors. Having to fix them all was a nightmare, as after making one mistake, I had to start the process all over again. Honestly, I think it builds character. Getting used to stuff like this makes a much better coder. At least VsCode actually tells you what was wrong in terms of syntax errors. 

## Coding Standards in the Future

Strict Coding Standards drive away new and aspiring software engineers. Luckily, new coding languages such as python make it more beginner friendly. I believe new languages from this point on should be easier, and have simpler, less strict syntax. The fact that sometimes a simple extra line breaks a code is frusturating at best, reason to quit at worse.
